Sometimes the use of certain terms in writing and conversation is so common, we think the usage is correct. So It’s no surprise I found these errors while editing authors’ work this week. But you don’t have to make the same mistakes.

For all six entries, you get the original usage, an explanation of the right terms, and a writing tip. Let’s go:

## 1\. *Semi* as in *semitrailer*

{:.red_centered}
Investigators believe they know why two semi-trucks hit head-on near
a Saranac gas station in a three-vehicle crash that killed a truck driver from Hudsonville.

The prefix *semi* means “half,” so its meaning hints at the meaning of *semitrailer.* Avoid calling something a *semitruck.* A semi is a trailer with a half-set of wheels — a pair on the back, but none on the front because the front of the rig is attached to the tractor or truck bed. Sometimes people refer to a *semi* meaning “a big truck,” but that’s technically wrong. A truck pulling a trailer with wheels on the front and the back is not a semi. It’s a big-ass tractor-trailer rig, something like a gravel hauler. The definitions beg the question, can two semis ever hit head-on? Probably not unless they were disconnected from their tractors and sliding down opposing snow slopes into a valley. Owever, two semis could have a rear-end collision in a parking lot.

{:.tips}
[Note: if you are a romance writer, then maybe you intend *semi* to mean something else entirely, so feel free to check the [Urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=semi) to confirm your understanding].

## 2\. *Cement* vs. *Concrete*

{:.red_centered}
*Jared was flung head-long toward the station wall; he tripped on his own coat,
cracked his head on the cement, and by the time he'd gotten back on his feet…*

Of course, it is possible Jared hurt his head on the cement, but he may have died if he hit his head on the concrete. Concrete and cement are distinct objects. Cement is a component of concrete. It’s the glue that holds together rocks, rebar, and sand. Mixed together with water, these elements create concrete. A consumer buys cement in a bag. A city hires a contractor to create a concrete sidewalk. A floater with a trowel may pull a large quantity of cement to the surface of his concrete mixture to create an extremely smooth pathway, but it was the hardened concrete that spilled Jared’s blood.

## 3\. *12:00 p.m.*

{:.red_centered}
A meeting of the New York State Law Enforcement Council is scheduled at 12:00 p.m.

The careful writer knows there is no such thing as 12:00 p.m. Neither is there any sense to 12:00 a.m. The abbreviation a.m. stands for *ante meridiem,* and p.m. means *post meridiem.* If the sun is directly overhead in the afternoon, it is precisely in alignment with the longitudinal meridian. The sun is neither in front of or behind the meridian. We have a term for that. It’s called noon. In the evening, the opposite is midnight. Also *midnight* is used to denote the part of the day that is ending, not the part that starting. Using a.m. and p.m. inappropriately can lead to confusion, which is why airlines and trains avoid scheduling transportation exactly at 12 noon. They prefer 12:01 p.m.

{:.tips}
[Tip: While we are on the subject, never write 12:01 p.m. this afternoon or anything similar; it is redundant.]

## 4\. *Robbed vs. Burgled*

{:.red_centered}
I am out some $3,000 due to my home being robbed when we weren't home.

Modern vernacular is erasing the distinction between the terms *robbery* and *burglary.* Polished writers are not confused. Robberies are usually done in person. Imagine a movie’s bank scene and or late-night liquor-store noir. Robbery is a crime defined by taking something of value by fear, force, or a threat of force. Fear, force and threats are absent to burglars. They usually break in stealthily and hope never to be discovered. When a stranger points a gun at clerk’s face and says, “Give all the cash in your drawer,” that’s a robbery. When the clerk goes home, and the perp breaks the store window and steals the safe, that’s a burglary.

{:.tips}
[Tip: To be more poetic with your crime scenes, try avoiding words ending in *ize*. Therefore, consider using the word *burgled* instead of *burglarized*.]
